# Machine Learning Algorithms

## About

This project includes a collection of **Machine Learning algorithms** implemented from **beginning to end**.  
The goal of this repository is to provide a complete learning reference, covering algorithms, models, and practical implementations in one place.

I started this repository to:
- Learn machine learning concepts step by step
- Implement algorithms clearly using Python
- Build models from data loading to evaluation

This repository is intended for **learning, experimentation, and reference**.
